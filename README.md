# Fuzzy-Logic-with-Matlab
### Project name exams_sum is a random name, Script can be applied to all different weighted features.
### Exam analysis can easily be understood by the user. So that data was chosen.
### Data was prepared by me. I tried to add all possible combination results for different level exams, yet up to some extend
### Since If too many data is given to the program, it decreases efficiency of the program and too much time needed at that case 
### Various fuzzy Logic membership functions were applied to the system. As a result, compare to the data given with excel, I obtained rates/percentages
### Changing #places at initial rows, you can check the membership function results
